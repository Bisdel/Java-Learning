# Tic-Tac-Toe !

After following the introduction course on Java from Openclassrooms.com, I trained myself by writing a classic Tic-Tac-Toe game, playable by 2 players.

New features to come :
- Playing alone with a bot (work in progress)
- Online 2-players by handling a TCP socket

Pull requests and comments are welcome, please be indulgent as I have never checked how other Tic-Tac-Toe games were written, this one was deliberately written from scratch.
